# Day 7 - extra stuff


Day 7 ? wait ! there was a day 7 ?

This is the hidden section for things not covered during the school ;-)

## Jupyter notebooks

Some of you probably use jupyter notebooks.
They are a great tool for data exploration and visualisation, as well as for documenting your analysis.
We don't recommend to use them for more than that though, keep your core analysis in `.py` files and packages, it makes it much easier to maintain and reuse.
