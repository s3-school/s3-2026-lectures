# Day 2 - Coding environment & practices

Teachers: [Vincent Pollet](mailto:vincent.pollet@lapp.in2p3.fr)

## Overview
This lecture covers how to set-up a reproducible environment for software project. Starting from the [pkoffee](https://github.com/s3-school/pkoffee/tree/Day0) experiment, we will add dependency and virtual environment management using [pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/) and demonstrate how to leverage IDEs features within these environments. Next, we briefly discuss good code practice and what modifications should be made in our example project. Finaly, we will complete our intial set-up by structuring the repository as a python and conda package project managed with pixi, to serve a basis for the rest of the school.
