# Day 2 - Git and GitHub basics

Teachers: Maximilian Linhoff

## Overview

* **Version Control Basics**: Explains that version control tracks document history, enables collaboration, and is essential for reproducible science.

* **Git Fundamentals**: Introduces the repository structure (working directory, staging area, and history) and core commands like `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit`.

* **Syncing and Collaboration**: Covers remote repositories, cloning, and syncing changes using `git push`, `git fetch`, and `git pull`.

* **Workflows**: Highlights the "GitHub Workflow," which involves creating short-lived feature branches and merging them into the main branch via Pull Requests.

* **Hosting Providers**: Compares major platforms like GitHub and GitLab, noting their additional features such as issue tracking and Continuous Integration (CI).

* **Advanced Features**: Discusses more complex tools like `git bisect` for finding bugs, submodules for managing dependencies, and history manipulation via `rebase` and `amend`.
